Hello, everyone! It's us again, Team `0range` from Vietnam. 🐻🐥🐰🎶

This October, we had the privilege of competing in the ASEAN Student Contest on Information Security (ASCIS), an event that brought together top university talent from across the ASEAN region. ASCIS is a Capture the Flag (CTF) contest where teams of up to four students test their cybersecurity skills. This year marks the 17th edition of ASCIS for Vietnamese students and the sixth year of ASEAN-wide participation. [Learn more here](https://ctf.vnisa.org.vn/).
